    <p>Venus, the "evening star," is a hellish world with crushing atmospheric pressure and a runaway greenhouse effect. Its yellowish clouds conceal a searing surface, making it Earth's twin gone awry.</p> 
    <br>

    <h2>The Planet Earth</h2>
    <p>Our home, the Blue Planet, is a haven for life with diverse ecosystems and a life-sustaining atmosphere. Its beauty lies in its water-covered surface, lush landscapes, and the nurturing embrace of the biosphere.</p>

    <p>Tilted on its side, Uranus rolls through space like a celestial oddball. Its pale blue hue and icy composition make it a unique member of our solar system.</p> 
    <br>

    <p>Neptune, the distant ice giant, sports deep-blue clouds and fierce winds. Its captivating appearance hides mysteries of its turbulent atmosphere and icy, uncharted depths.</p> 
    <br>
